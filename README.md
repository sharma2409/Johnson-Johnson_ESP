- The analysis is performed by fitting the ARIMA and SARIMA statistical model.
- Log-time differencing is performed to convert the time-series from up-trending time series to a stationary time-series. 
- Hyperparameter tuning for these models is done by custom optimizers and the optimum parameters are chosen based on AIC as a metric. 
- Forecasting of next 8 quarters is also done to demonstrate prediction capabilities.
